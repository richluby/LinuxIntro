### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to introduce students to the Unix Family of operating systems.  This lab will mostly consit of short reading and discussion sections.

#### 1. Unix & Linux 

The Linux architecture is originally based on the UNIX system produced by AT&T. Due to the licensing of the original codebase, Linus Torvalds began creating his own OS to run on personal hardware. Gradually, the system attracted fellow developers and gained traction in the CS community.

Use google to help you answer the following questions related to the Unix family tree diagram.

> How much did a PDP-7 cost?

> Which company created the System III operating system? What year?

> Which university was BSD created at?

> What was the intended name of Linux before settling on Linux?

> What does "Free as in beer" mean? What is the corollary?

#### 2. POSIX

Portable Operating System Interface, or POSIX, defines a set of standards designed to improve the compatibility of UNIX-based operating systems. It describes the Application Programming Interface (API), shell environments, and other necessary components of a system.

When you write your programs to rely on POSIX standards, you can be pretty sure to be able to port them easily among a large family of Unix derivatives (including Linux, but not limited to it!); if and when you use some Linux API that's not standardized as part of Posix, you will have a harder time if and when you want to port that program or library to other Unix-y systems (e.g., MacOSX) in the future.

*But why did it happen?*

The United States government is the largest single organization procuring computer equipment in the world. Using the POSIX.1 Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 151-2 [4] and its POSIX Certification Test Suite (PCTS), it acted as a huge impetus to developing POSIX.1 certified implementations. (3)

*What is in there?*

Lot's of low level details that we won't get into, but imagine just about any aspect of an operating system you would want to build on.  POSIX has some standard for how it should be interfaced and communicated with.
